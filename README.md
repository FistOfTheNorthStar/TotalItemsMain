Plant A Tree - https://www.planteenboom.nu

Project to sell more trees to offset CO2.
Support is welcome, you can go to the site and find a way to contribute.
We are migrating one service at a time.

## Original project cleanup
Originally this project was a ticket selling system with a websocket reservation notifier from Sidekiq. However after discussions with PlantEnBoom and looking at their needs there are several things that had not converged thus cleaning up is needed and there are bunch of files just commented out. The discussion is different now on what is actually required.

Basically the project will add Webhooks to notify the backend of any new customers or bought trees from Shopify, from ChargeBee we get the suvscriptions, and accordingly the process is automated so that only a few steps require aminds to touch anymore. CRM is updated and trees allocated to users, then customes are emailed via CRM (also automated) and there will be a link on the email where user can go and print a certificate with unique codes of each tree owned.

Add some forms in React, and some self created analytics on how much C92 the user has offset.

Add logic 

## DATABASE
Using postgres, so you need to setup postgres
On Mac
```brew install postgresql@15```

## Install gems
```bundle install```

## Generate dashboards for administrate
```rails generate administrate:dashboard ModelName```

## Run tests
```bundle exec rspec spec```

## Sidekiq
Check that redis is running and url matches to your settings.
```bundle exec sidekiq```

## Guard
Remember to init your guard
```bundle exec guard init```
and run
```bundle exec guard```

## Reek
Check stinky code, so many opinions, I relaxed rules
```bundle exec reek .```
or to file
```bundle exec reek . --format html > reek_results.html```

## Pricing functions
Pricing functions will have precision 15 and scale 6. US tax code has for example this type 6.1235% calculations, and there are currencies that you need to multiply by one million to dollar.
